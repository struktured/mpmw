##**Notice**##

This project is currently defunct and may be rejuvenated with some twists, such as the use of the future api and protocol buffers. For now, consider using https://github.com/issuu/ocaml-zmq and/or https://github.com/struktured/riakc_ppx.


Multipurpose middleware for ocaml to do serialization, distributed caching and high performance messaging. This is accomplished by leveraging the following
three technologies in combination:

1. zeromq
2. riak
3. bin prot
